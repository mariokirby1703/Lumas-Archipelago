## Notes

This is version 0.1.0 of the Carnival Games MiniGolf APWorld.

The default configuration has 179 locations. Every normal hole always has a Complete and Par Club Piece location.
Hole-in-One locations exist only for the 19 holes where a Hole-in-One is possible. The nine Adventure minigames can
provide Win and Perfect locations; Devil's Brew - Spiders provides Win only.

Par Club Piece locations and received Par Club Piece items are separate. The locations record playing a hole on Par
or better; the received items unlock that world's Pro Shop tiers. Barker counter goals use received Archipelago
Barker Coins and automatically remove Barker Shop locations.

The maximum requirement of 41 Barker Coins remains generatable with every optional check family disabled. In Goal
World mode, the six Complete and Par Club Piece checks in the Goal World are behind its Access item, leaving exactly
enough reachable mandatory checks for 41 Barker Coins and the other seven World Access items.

Normal coins can be earned repeatedly in any open world, so Coin Bundles are useful assistance rather than required
progression. Coin Traps are optional and default to a weight of 10%.
